# analysis-code
This repository contains all R and Python scripts used for the statistical analyses and visualizations in our study on the rhizosphere resistome. The analyses integrate multivariate statistics, network analysis, and machine learning to explore the patterns and drivers of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) assemblages across diverse crop rhizospheres.
